### Instructions for Setting Up Each Repository:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   - To clone any of the repositories, use the command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/praveennarasimmands/S3-Bucket_policy_mastery.git
     ```

2. **Create an S3 Bucket**:
   - Go to AWS S3 Console and create a new bucket to store sensitive data.
   - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.

3. **Apply IAM Policies**:
   - Create IAM roles in the AWS Console or use the AWS CLI to define policies.
   - Attach these policies to the appropriate user or group.

4. **Implement Bucket Policies**:
   - Copy the `bucket-policy.json` examples provided in the repository.
   - Apply the policies in the AWS Console or using the AWS CLI to ensure that only authorized users can access the data.

5. **Security Best Practices**:
   - Always test policies in a development environment first.
   - Ensure that S3 bucket permissions are never too permissive (i.e., avoid using `public-read` or `public-write` unless necessary).
   - Regularly review access logs and monitor the activity to detect unauthorized access.
